""""Multiple Linear Regression
Until this point, we have predicted a value with linear regression using only one variable. There is a different scenario that we can consider, where we can predict 
using many variables instead of one, and this is also a much more common scenario in real life, where many things can affect some result.

For instance, if we want to predict the gas consumption in US states, it would be limiting to use only one variable, for instance, gas taxes to do it, since more than 
just gas taxes affects consumption. There are more things involved in the gas consumption than only gas taxes, such as the per capita income of the people in a certain
 area, the extension of paved highways, the proportion of the population that has a driver's license, and many other factors. Some factors affect the consumption more 
 than others - and here's where correlation coefficients really help!"""

#Following what we did with the linear regression, we will also want to know our data before applying multiple linear regression. First, we can import the data with pandas read_csv() method:

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

path_to_file = 'week5/petrol_consumption.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(path_to_file)

print("df.head():  \n",df.head())

print("df.shape: \n" , df.shape)

print("df.describe().round(2).T:    \n",df.describe().round(2).T)


import seaborn as sns # Convention alias for Seaborn

variables = ['Petrol_tax', 'Average_income', 'Paved_Highways','Population_Driver_licence(%)']

for var in variables:
    plt.figure() # Creating a rectangle (figure) for each plot
    # Regression Plot also by default includes
    # best-fitting regression line
    # which can be turned off via `fit_reg=False`
    sns.regplot(x=var, y='Petrol_Consumption', data=df).set(title=f'Regression plot of {var} and Petrol Consumption');
    plt.show()

read = input("Wait here: \n")


plt.figure()
"""We can also calculate the correlation of the new variables, this time using Seaborn's heatmap() to help us spot the strongest and weaker correlations based on warmer (reds) and cooler (blues) tones:"""
correlations = df.corr()
print("correlations...\n" , correlations)
# annot=True displays the correlation values
g = sns.heatmap(correlations, annot=True).set(title='Heat map of Consumption Data - Pearson Correlations')
# Display the plot
plt.show()
read = input("Wait for me....")

"""Preparing the Data
Following what has been done with the simple linear regression, after loading and exploring the data, we can divide it into features and targets. The main difference is that now our features have 4 columns instead of one.

We can use double brackets [[ ]] to select them from the dataframe:"""

#To train our model we can execute the same code as before, and use the fit() method of the LinearRegression class:

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
regressor = LinearRegression()

regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

#After fitting the model and finding our optimal solution, we can also look at the intercept:
print("regressor.intercept_......\n", regressor.intercept_)

#And at the coefficients of the features
